# social-network-api

## Introduction

This project is a backend API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose to provide a robust and flexible solution for handling large amounts of unstructured data. The API allows for CRUD operations on users, thoughts, and reactions, providing a foundational backend service for a social media platform.

## Installation

Clone the repository, install dependencies, set up the environment variables, and run the server.

## Usage

To test the API you can use tools like Insomnia or Postman. Here are some of the key functionalities:<br>
-Users: Create, read, update, and delete users<br>
-Thoughts: Create, read, update, and delete thoughts<br>
-Reactions: Add and remove reactions to thoughts<br>
-Friends: Add and remove friends from a user's friend list
